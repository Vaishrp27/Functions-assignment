        "1.What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, both functions and methods are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks, but they have distinct differences in their usage and context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "Ans.In Python, the terms arguments and parameters are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings and roles in the context of functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python\n",
        "Ans.In Python, you can call a function within another function, which is a common practice to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The return statement in Python is used to end the execution of a function and return a value to the caller\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, iterators and iterables are fundamental concepts that are closely linked but serve different purposes\n",
        "\n",
        "6.. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Generators in Python are a special type of function that return an iterator using the yield keyword\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Generators allow you to create iterators in a very pythonic manner,useful for very large data sets, better than Iterators.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Lambda functions in Python are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. lambda functions do not have a name and are limited to a single expression\n",
        "\n",
        "9.Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. It applies a given function to each item of an iterable such as a list or tuple and returns a map object, which is an iterator of the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The map function is used to apply a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a map object (which is an iterator) of the results\n",
        "The filter function is used to filter elements from an iterable based on a function that returns a Boolean value. It creates a new list containing only the elements for which the function returns True.\n",
        "Python’s reduce() function doesn’t return a new sequence like map() and filter(). Instead, it returns a single value\n",
